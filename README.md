# Citadel Studios #

‘Citadel Studios’ is my final coursework submission for my studies at Code Institute. The site is an e-commerce site for a fictional recording studio in Donegal, Ireland. Site users can create profiles, order recording packages, read blog posts on the studio's equipment and client roster, fill out and submit a ‘Contact Us’ and ‘Newsletter’ form, and follow external links to the studio’s Facebook Business Page, and Google Maps address link.
